<br/><p> Making a love connection: </p>
             
                    <br/><p>The truth is, there’s no telling when that one-of-a-kind connection will happen or what it will take for two souls to spark. However, astrology and horoscopes are meant to guide all of the zodiac signs toward the right path to their future—and true love. So if you’re looking at a potential romantic candidate, you may want to take into consideration what astrologers have to say about zodiac compatibility. While every zodiac sign has attractive qualities, not all of them work well together</p>
                    <br/> <iframe style={style}src="/images/f13.jpg"></iframe>
                  <br/>Of course, that doesn’t mean that if you and your partner have clashing signs, you should just throw your hands in the air and walk away. Even astrologers warn their followers not to break up with their lovers over this information. “In lived reality, a person has a couple of primary signs, so the sun sign won’t be the only indication of whether a couple is compatible,” says astrologer Emily Ridout.
                  <br/>“So, even if you and your partner don’t match up initially, don’t despair! For best results with this information, compare a few placements in the chart, such as moon signs (emotional compatibility), Venus signs (love compatibility), and Mars signs (chemistry).” Knowing and understanding other parts of your birth chart, like your rising sign, can help you figure out those nuances.

                  <br/>But as far as compatibility among the sun signs is concerned, here is how matters of the heart usually play out. For an even more comprehensive look at love and life, you’ll also want to learn about your Chinese zodiac, zodiac element, and what the year has in store for you.

                  <br/><p>Aries (March 21–April 19)</p>
                  <br/>Aries is a dominant personality. People of this sign tend to be eager and ready to take the lead; they are all about action and will face problems head-on. When it comes to romantic relationships, they need someone who won’t get in their way. “Aries is primarily looking for a partner who will encourage their outer expression and not dampen their zest for life,” Ridout says. Of course, that doesn’t mean they want a complete doormat, either. An ideal partner would be someone who knows how to handle Aries without butting heads.
                  <br/><p>Compatible signs</p>
                  <br/>Sagittarius is a great companion because people of this sign are adventurous and outgoing; the two will sustain each other’s energy. Gemini is a good match for similar reasons, while Libra could also forge a bond based on mutual respect and understanding.
                  <br/><p>Non-compatible signs</p>
                  <br/>Aries is too bullish for signs like Scorpio and Cancer. Virgo would also be an improper pairing because the two would constantly clash over what they see as the right course of action. The last thing you want is to be stressed in your relationship.
                  <br/> <iframe style={style}src="/images/f15.jpg"></iframe>
                  <br/><p>Taurus (April 20–May 20)</p>
                  <br/>The fixed earth sign of Taurus is pretty set in its ways. Sometimes this can mean that Bulls are stubborn, but on a deeper level, they are sure of who they are and what they want. “Taurus is primarily looking for a partner who will appreciate their pace, their passion, and their desire to hold their inner awareness and power,” Ridout explains. Literally and figuratively, Taurus is a rock for their true love and will stand by them no matter what. Looking to shower your love with presents?

                  <br/><p>Compatible signs</p>
                  <br/>The other earth signs, Capricorn and Virgo, make a great match for Taurus, as they share the same fundamental nature. (That’s basically the essence of zodiac compatibility.) Cancer is also a good choice, too, because they are just as passionate and caring as Taurus, and they take their dedication to their loved ones equally seriously.
                  <br/><p>Non-compatible signs</p>
            
                  <br/>For as much as Taurus loves opulence and sensuality, this sign does not appreciate show-offs when it comes to relationships. Leo, Aquarius, and Sagittarius are too excitable for Taurus, who prefers a more grounded temperament.

                  <br/><p>Gemini (May 21–June 20)</p>
                  <br/>Geminis love to have fun and tend to be hard to pin down. They go where the wind takes them, and they need a partner who is just as agile. Ridout sums it up by saying, “Gemini [wants] a partner who will encourage their free thought and go with them on mini-adventures that allow the good times to roll.”
                  <br/><p>Compatible signs</p>
                  <br/>As someone who can see two sides to any argument, Libra is perfectly suited to Gemini, the sign of the Twins. Where some might call Gemini two-faced, Libra understands that there is more to them than meets the eye. Additionally, Sagittarius and Aquarius share the same intellectual curiosity and need for exploration as Gemini.
                  <br/><p>Non-compatible signs</p>
                  <br/>Capricorn and Taurus do not like the unpredictable nature of this sign, which they see as flighty. Scorpio may also feel naturally distrustful of Gemini. While we’re on the subject, find out how trustworthy each sign is.

                  <br/><p>Cancer (June 21–July 22)</p>
                  <br/>Whether we’re talking about food, presents, or attention, Cancer is a loving sign who enjoys giving, and they seek someone who shares those same values. “Cancer is looking for a partner who makes them feel at home and who takes care of themselves and others,” Ridout says. They are more than willing to be the shoulder you can cry on, and they will feel secure in a relationship that provides them with that same comfort.
                  <br/><p>Compatible signs</p>
                  <br/>Scorpio and Pisces, two very intuitive and emotional signs, will deeply appreciate Cancer’s love and dedication. Virgo also loves to nurture and cherishes a reliable partner like Cancer.
                  <br/><p>Non-compatible signs</p>
                  Gemini, Sagittarius, and Leo are too independent and won’t satisfy Cancer, who needs to be needed. They’re not necessarily selfish, but they don’t crave that same level of domesticity.
