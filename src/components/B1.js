    Metal signs:<br/>
<br/><p> Metal governs the Chinese zodiac signs Monkey and Rooster. The planet Venus is associated with metal because it is white in color (the Chinese color of death), and rises in the west as the evening star.</p>
                     <br/><p>In Chinese philosophy, metal or gold (Chinese: 金; pinyin: jīn), the fourth phase of Wu Xing, is the decline of the matter, or the matter's decline stage.[1] In Traditional Chinese Medicine Metal is yin in character, its motion is inwards and its energy is contracting. It is associated with the west, autumn, it governs the Yin, Zang organ the Lung and the Yang, Fu organ colon, nose and skin, old age, the planet Saturn, the colour white, dry weather, and the White Tiger (Bai Hu) in Four Symbols. The archetypal metals are silver or gold.</p>
                    Colors <p> Color should be understood in a global sense rather than an analytical one, visual rather than factual, sensual. The perception of colors depends on a certain equilibrium of luminosity: in darkness everything is black, and in very bright light one similarly cannot distinguish colors. Goethe puts forward in the fourth part of his treatise two essential ideas: the origin of colors (from Blue to Yellow) as a function of darkness and light, and the constitution of the "final" color, Red, by means of the intensification of each of the two primary colors. [5]  Thus Red is the final stage of a darkening of Yellow, as it is of a lightening of Blue. Three intermediary colors (Green, Purple and Orange) achieve chromatic disposition through the evolution and combination of the three principal colors. In fact, Yellow, which comes from light, and Blue, which comes from darkness, combine to give Green and intensify into Orange and Purple, then Red.<br/> The genetic theory of colors that Goethe opposes to Newtonian experimentation, i.e. that of the spectral array of white light into seven colors (of which one, indigo, is artificial, no doubt added to satisfy the requirements of analogy between the color spectrum and the musical scale), rings true with the experience of artisan dyers and painters, Leonardo da Vinci being one example, who also identified colors of light (red and yellow) and colors of darkness (blue and green). </p>

                   <br/> The Planetary Week and Metals:<br/><p>"Thus we discovered that the seven metals of the alchemical tradition, i.e. silver, mercury, gold, lead, iron, copper and tin, produced very particular variations in the DNA molecule." (Étienne Guillé)<br/>
 
<br/>     Another artificial application of the planetary week is found in the system of faces, or Zodiacal decans ruled by the planets: each of the 36 decans is held to be governed by a planet of the Septenary according to the same decreasing order of their sidereal revolutions, beginning this time with Mars, ruler of the first decan of Aries, then moving to Mercury, ruler of the first decan of Taurus, then to Jupiter for the first decan of Gemini, and ultimately to Saturn, Jupiter and Mars for the first, second and third decans of Pisces. In this manner the planets governing the first decans of the Zodiacal signs succeed one another in the order of the planetary week, from Mars in Aries to Moon in Libra, then again from Mars in Scorpio to Saturn in Pisces.
 The days of the week, in most of the Indo-European languages, have names associated with the planets: Mon-day (day of the Moon) ... through Sun-day (day of the Sun). Even though this "astrological" legacy may be firmly anchored in our vocabulary and culture, these attributions have no strict astrological value, since they occurred through a simple arithmetic process without any physical foundation. The planetary week, attested as early as the 2nd century BCE, is ostensibly of Mesopotamian or Syrian origin: the Greeks and the Egyptians, in contradistinction to the Semitic peoples, did not know a week of seven days.</p>
   <br/>    Moon + Saturn = Sun + Jupiter
<br/>Moon + Venus = Mars + Jupiter
<br/>Sun + Venus = Mars + Saturn

<br/>Mercury + Uranus = Neptune + Plato
<br/>Venus + Neptune = Mars + Uranus
<br/>Sun + Pluto = Mercury + Saturn

<br/>Moon + Uranus = Jupiter + Neptune
<br/>Moon + Pluto = Mercury + Jupiter
<br/>Mercury + Venus = Mars + Pluto
<br/>Sun + Uranus = Saturn + Neptune
<br/>  The relationships proceed from the "circular" band that follows, in which the planets and their associated metals are placed in order of their chromatic succession, the planets of opening on top (warm colors) and the planets of closure on bottom (cool colors):
