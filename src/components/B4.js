<br/><p> Making a Work connection: </p>
             
  <br/><p>Virgos make great employees! Adept at critical thinking, analysis, and keeping track of small details, Virgos can definitely help lighten the burden of responsibility for coworkers. Be careful, though, Virgos -- your sharp tongue, impatience, and tendency to criticize others can sometimes lead to strained relationships. </p>
   <br/>Virgos make great employees! Adept at critical thinking, analysis, and keeping track of small details, Virgos can definitely help lighten the burden of responsibility for coworkers. Be careful, though, Virgos -- your sharp tongue, impatience, and tendency to criticize others can sometimes lead to strained relationships.<br/>
   <br/><p>Virgo and Aries:</p>
   <br/>Aries likes to push their way to the front of the line, while you patiently wait your turn. The Ram believes that their way is always best, while you prefer exploring a variety of techniques before choosing the best one. Aries wants to hold the reins of power, while you’d rather be of service. Can this work partnership succeed? Yes, if you remind yourself not to undercut your colleague’s enthusiasm.<br/>When Aries comes to you with one of their brilliant ideas, listen patiently and then praise their innovation. Wait an hour or two before posing practical questions like, "How will we finance this project?" or "Do we have the skills to make this successful?" The two of you would work very well at an architecture firm, real estate business, or security firm. If you work for an employer, let your Aries colleague fight all the battles, while you do all the groundwork.<br/>

   <br/><p>Virgo and Taurus:</p>
   <br/>This work partnership is a match made in heaven. Both you and Taurus are practical people who want secure jobs. And while Taurus has an eye for beauty, you’ve got a knack for details that can add up to an impressive presentation. The two of you would do very well as landscape artists, interior designers, or artisans. If you’re working for an employer, let the Bull deal with the stressful aspects of the job<br/>
    <br/>This sign is pretty impervious to anxiety. You’re better suited to detail-oriented work like research, editing, and fact-checking. Be sure to let Taurus decorate their work space with plants, artwork, and creature comforts. While these things may seem like silly frivolities to you, they’re absolute necessities to this luxury-loving sign.<br/>
    <br/><p>Virgo and Gemini:</p>
    <br/>You and Gemini are both ruled by intellectual Mercury, but you differ in significant ways. For one thing, you like to find practical applications for the facts you gather, while Gemini enjoys gathering information just for pure enjoyment. Before you assume that your colleague is totally frivolous, though, pause to consider how many random pieces of knowledge your colleague possesses that have actually come in handy.<br/>

 <br/><p>Virgo and Cancer:</p>
 <br/>You appreciate Cancer’s thoughtful attitude toward work, while this sign admires your attention to detail. When you’re tired and cranky, this colleague brings you a hot cup of tea and a bran muffin. When the Crab’s upset by a rude customer, you leap to your coworker’s defense. The two of you operate like well-oiled machinery. If you’d like to go into business together, consider a healing profession like acupuncture, physical therapy, or massage.<br/>
 <br/><p>Virgo and Leo:</p>
 <br/>On the surface, it seems like you and Leo are complete opposites. Leo likes opulent luxury, while you prefer elegant simplicity. The Lion’s got an ego the size of Texas, while yours is more the size of Rhode Island. Your colleague prefers to look at the big picture, but you are captivated by small details. Is there any way the two of you can form a harmonious partnership? Yes! First of all, it’s important to know that both of you crave financial security.<br/>
 <br/><p>Virgo and Virgo:</p>
 <br/>Teaming up with another Virgo could be a winning strategy for you. After all, you can grow weary of being the only one competent enough to deal with niggling details. Having another Virgo by your side will give you the welcome assurance of working with someone who is just as efficient as you are. Similarly, you always enjoy working with a colleague who can provide you with plenty of intellectual stimulation, and another Virgo will do just that<br/>
